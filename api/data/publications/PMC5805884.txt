Strains 1P01SCT, FO-92T, 50v1, and 2P01AA, were sequenced using a shotgun sequencing approach on the Illumina HiSeq paired-end platform. The reads were de novo assembled using CLC Genomics Workbench version 10.1.1, resulting in total genome sizes of 5,500,894 bp, 4,699,376 bp, 3,174,402 bp, and 4,328,804 bp, respectively. Genome statistics are given in Table 1 for all the strains. Annotations were produced using both the Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology server (6) and the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (7, 8) and visualized using the SEED viewer (9).
Genome statistics of four microbial strains isolated from spacecraft hardware and associated surfaces
The Bacillus strains 1P01SCT and FO-92T had 103 and 99 putative genes coding for dormancy and sporulation, respectively. Both strains had MutS, RecA, MutL, excinuclease ABC, beta-lactamase, and genes coding for the formation of persister cells (10). Strain FO-92T had a prophage-associated DNA repair protein (RecT), six genes associated with spore DNA protection, exodeoxyribonuclease III, and a peroxide stress regulator (PerR). Strain 1P01SCT had cold shock proteins (CspD and CspA) and a heat-inducible transcriptional repressor (HrcA).
The genome sequences of all four isolates have been deposited at DDBL/EMBL/GenBank under the accession numbers listed in Table 1.

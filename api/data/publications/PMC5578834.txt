Until recently, there were two bacterial species in the genus Solibacillus (S. isronensis and S. silvestris), and draft genomes of both species have been completed (3, 4). In an ongoing microbiological survey from 2014 to 2017, a novel bacterial species was isolated from a high-energy particulate arrestance (HEPA) filter system aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The round spore-forming bacterium was described as Solibacillus kalamii (5), and here we present its draft genome. The HEPA filter was in service for 40 months on the ISS before being brought back to earth for further microbiological and molecular analyses (5).
In this study, we characterize the draft whole-genome sequence of strain S. kalamii ISSFR-015 (NRRL 65388T = DSM 101595T), which provides insight on putative genes coding for superoxide dismutase, universal stress proteins, vancomycin resistance, copper resistance, hydrogen peroxide resistance, and arsenic resistance. This evidence is suggestive of the bacterium’s success in surviving the high-stress environment of the ISS and the harsh cleaning procedures during spacecraft assembly.
The genome sequences of S. kalamii ISSFR-015 have been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession number NHNT00000000.

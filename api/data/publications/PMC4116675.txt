In P. aeruginosa, alginate overproduction, also known as mucoidy, is negatively regulated by the transmembrane protein MucA, which sequesters the alternative sigma factor AlgU. MucA is degraded via a proteolysis pathway that frees AlgU from sequestration, activating alginate biosynthesis. Initiation of this pathway normally requires two signals: peptide sequences in unassembled outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) activate the AlgW protease, and unassembled lipopolysaccharides bind periplasmic MucB, releasing MucA and facilitating its proteolysis by activated AlgW. To search for novel alginate regulators, we screened a transposon library in the non-mucoid reference strain PAO1, and identified a mutant that confers mucoidy through overexpression of a protein encoded by the chaperone-usher pathway gene cupB5. CupB5-dependent mucoidy occurs through the AlgU pathway and can be reversed by overexpression of MucA or MucB. In the presence of activating OMP peptides, peptides corresponding to a region of CupB5 needed for mucoidy further stimulated AlgW cleavage of MucA in vitro. Moreover, the CupB5 peptide allowed OMP-activated AlgW cleavage of MucA in the presence of the MucB inhibitor. These results support a novel mechanism for conversion to mucoidy in which the proteolytic activity of AlgW and its ability to compete with MucB for MucA is mediated by independent peptide signals.

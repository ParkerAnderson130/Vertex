In a screening project of natural products, fungal strains isolated from environments associated with the Chernobyl nuclear power plant (ChNPP) accident (1) have been investigated. The radiation-tolerant microorganisms selected for exposure to microgravity at the International Space Station were known to produce valuable natural products; their genomic sequences coded for secondary metabolism pathways; or they displayed positive radiotropism.
The whole-genome sequences of these eight fungal strains were obtained by shotgun sequencing performed on an Illumina HiSeq2500 platform with a paired-end module. The NGS QC toolkit version 2.3 (22) was used to filter the data for high-quality vector- and adaptor-free reads for genome assembly (cutoff read length for high quality: 80%; cutoff quality score: 20). High-quality vector-filtered reads were used for assembly with the MaSuRCA genome assembler (k-mer size = 70) (23). Data from the final assembly of the strains, including number of scaffolds, total size, N50 contig length, G+C content, and GenBank accession numbers, are given in Table 1.
